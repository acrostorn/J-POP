**By comparing the two images, it becomes clear that the number of people aged 80–84 in this region will increase between 2025 and 2030.**

You can visually see population change forecasts on a map, as well as through population pyramids. This makes it clear which regions are experiencing increases or decreases in population, and which groups (by gender and age) are changing.

## 2. AI-POWERED ANALYSIS
Users can ask questions via the chat displayed on the screen, and the AI will analyze the characteristics of the population in that region and provide answers.
